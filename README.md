Historical Inquiry Web Application is an idea to create a web-based application to allow teachers the ability to create mini archives for student's use in historical analysis. The model being used for this process is Summarizing, Contextualizing, Inferring, Monitoring and Corroborating Interpretation (SCIM-CI). [Read more about the strategy here.](http://historicalinquiry.com/#part2) This model is being used for several reasons:
* SCIM-CI is well researched
* SCIM-CI is simple to understand
* SCIM-CI is adaptable to a variety of settings/historical pursuits
* SCIM-CI is compatible with the C3 Inquiry Design Model
* SCIM-CI is broken into component pieces, and should be possible to put into a web app

Once this app is completed, students should be able to select from a set of primary source materials, highlight text, which will be entered into an, "excerpts" box, and then they can answer a question from the SCIM-CI model. Additionally, there should be options for students to use materials they analyzed as sources for their final interpretation of the historical events. 

The teacher should be able to pull up student's work at any time and evaluate students' progress towards a comprehensive historical analysis of the topic at hand. Final interpretations of historical events should include student citations hotlinked and easily accessed by the teacher. Additional options for grading and teacher's ability to add comments into the submission would be ideal.

TODO:
* retrieve highlighted text
* store highlighted text with analysis
* store analysis in analysis tab
* store information in database
